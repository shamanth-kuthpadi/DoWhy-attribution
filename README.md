# Causal Tasks with DoWhy

There are a number of causal questions that we could ask about a given dataset. Some of these include:

1. Effect estimation
   - If we change X, how much will it cause Y to change?
2. Attribution
   - Why did an event happen?
   - How to explain an outcome?
   - Which of my variables caused the anomaly?
3. Counterfactual estimation
   - What if X had been changed to a different value than its observed one?
4. Prediction
   - Given a new input with different input features, what will be the output?
